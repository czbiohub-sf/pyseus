# Pyseus: Perseus in Python

This repository contains source code and notebooks to process and analyze Mass-Spec output from the MaxQuant software, mainly utilizing the proteingroups.txt output file. However, the code could accept most feature tables that follow a standard format.

The repository also contains a Dash App that provides a GUI for Pyseus processing and plotting functions. 

For more tutorials and details of the source code and the Dash App, please refer to the repository's [Read-the-Docs](https://pyseus-czb.readthedocs.io/en/main/) page.
